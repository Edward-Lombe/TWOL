      | Who am I?
    p.
      I am simply someone who likes to learn and
      create, usually, but not neccessarily in
      that order. The process of taking something
      so abstract as an idea in my head and then
      slowly turning it into reality is one that
      I find deep fascination and reward in.

      | What is this?
    p.
      This is a collection of most of my learnings and creations,
      an exibition of sorts of things I am proud to say came
      from my own hand, an the process involved in getting
      there.
